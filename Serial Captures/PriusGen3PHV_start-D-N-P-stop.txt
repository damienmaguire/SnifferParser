PriusGen3PHV_start-D-N-P-stop

Test was basically stationary on an uphill slope.
- Turned car on
- put into drive which pulled the car forward on the parkbrake
- footbrake may have been applied at this point
- changed to N, then P, then off.
- Footbrake might have been removed after, leading to car settling back on break
- No timing data recorded

The PHV data appears to be 105bytes HTM, 140bytes MTH.
Unfortunately the sniffer attempts to cut messages at 121 bytes.
This is needed as FIFO is 128 bytes long.
MTH messages are mostly cut at 121/19, however some have the split later.
This validates the need to leave some margin for the RTOS.
No overrun observed in this capture.
